= Reeper

WARNING: This is a fork of the NIST Reeper software originally at
https://sourceforge.net/p/reeper/[Sourceforge]. It is forked for
potential improvements.

The mirrored branch is located at the
https://github.com/metanorma/reeper/tree/original[`original` branch]

== Purpose

Reeper is a set of Ruby tools for harvesting ISO EXPRESS data models.

See https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/reeper[NIST's Reeper page] for further details.

== TODO

We will need to structure this as a Ruby gem with a command-line interface using Thor.

== Usage

The various mapping files are versioned independently of the `reeper.rb` file.

The tools have been tested on Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP and OS X and so are compatible with
multiple versions of Ruby.

The input format for the tool is an XML format that is based on the standard EXPRESS DTD.
The freely available Eurostep eep parser (http://www.eurostep.com) can produce this format.
