image:https://github.com/metanorma/reeper/workflows/rake/badge.svg[GitHub Workflow Status, link="https://github.com/metanorma/reeper/actions?workflow=rake"]

WARNING: This is a fork of the NIST Reeper software originally at
https://sourceforge.net/p/reeper/[Sourceforge]. It is forked for
potential improvements.

The mirrored branch is located at the
https://github.com/metanorma/reeper/releases/tag/v0.1[`pre-release` tag]

== Purpose

Reeper is a set of Ruby tools for harvesting ISO EXPRESS data models.

See https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/reeper[NIST's Reeper page] for further details.

It accepts the input of the following format:

* EXPRESS XML (ISO 10303-28:2007
"`Industrial automation systems and integration — Product data representation and exchange — Part 28: Implementation methods: XML representations of EXPRESS schemas and data, using XML schemas`")

NOTE: Reeper does not accept ASCII EXPRESS (ISO 10303-11) input today.
Something may have to be done about this.

And outputs the following formats:

* W3C OWL
* OMG SysML (XMI 2.1, XMI 2.5)
* OMG UML 2 (XMI 2.1)
* OMG UML 2 for Eclipse (XMI 2.1)

== Origin of name

Reeper was likely to have been named by Eurostep as the "`Ruby
version`" of their `eep` parser which stood for `Eurostep EXPRESS
Parser`.
The origin of the suffix `er` is so far unknown.
